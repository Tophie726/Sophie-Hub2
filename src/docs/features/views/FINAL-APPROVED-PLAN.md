# Views Feature — Final Approved Plan

Date: 2026-02-09  
Status: PARTIAL APPROVAL (Partner Type Delta shipped on `codex/views`)

## Approved Scope (Current)

- Partner-type computed logic rollout:
  - legacy vs staffing-derived comparison,
  - mismatch visibility in partners table,
  - `PPC Strategist` front-end labeling update.
- Evidence tracked in:
  - `src/docs/features/views/05-rollout-partner-type.md`

## Not Yet Approved (Remaining Views Program)

- Full `See as` control-plane and runtime context switching.
- `/admin/views` assignment UI and precedence runtime resolution.
- Full phase-gated rollout across all audience views.

## Remaining Approval Gate

- The full views program remains gated until:
  1. `02-claude-agent-plan.md` is complete,
  2. `03-codex-review.md` has no unresolved `P1`,
  3. `04-claude-revision.md` maps findings with risk owners,
  4. smoke evidence for full views workflow is complete.
