# Views Feature — Claude Agent Plan

Date: 2026-02-09  
Round: 02 (Pending Claude agent planning pass)

## Status

- Pending generation from `01-codex-proposal.md`.
- This file is intentionally scaffolded to preserve BAM loop structure and branch checkpoint.

## Required Next Step

1. Convert the Codex proposal into wave-based execution:
   - parallel tasks,
   - dependency graph,
   - implementation checkpoints,
   - validation ownership.

2. Include:
   - explicit migration rollback steps,
   - API contract examples,
   - smoke evidence collection plan.
